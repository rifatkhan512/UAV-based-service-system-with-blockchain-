camera calibration - done
calculating distance - done

x = right/left
y = front/back
z = up/down (it will always be positive)

algo:
1. calculate distance (find x,y,z and save it somewhere,
may be pass in a function and exit(0))
2. first go right/left (using x)
3. then go forward/backward (using y)
4. land
